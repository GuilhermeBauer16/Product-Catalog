# Product Catalog

## Objective

## Learnings 

In that project, I learned how to use the concept of VO(Value Object) to not expose the original entity, instead of using the VO class that looks like a mirror of that original entity to make the database transition more secure for don't expose the data of the original entity, for help me to make that I use the dependency Model mapper. I also learned that my project supports more than one data serialization, supported JSON, YAML, and XML via header. I use the dependency Jackson data format to make that. I also learned to use UUID and how to Primary key instead of long or big int in my tables for more security.
